/// The engine is a component owned by the shell that resides on the UI task
/// runner and is responsible for managing the needs of the root isolate and its
/// runtime. The engine can only be created, accessed and collected on the UI
/// task runner. Each shell owns exactly one instance of the engine.
///
/// The root isolate of Flutter application gets "window" bindings. Using these
/// bindings, the application can schedule frames, post layer-trees for
/// rendering, ask to decompress images and upload them to the GPU, etc..
/// Non-root isolates of the VM do not get any of these capabilities and are run
/// in a VM managed thread pool (so if they did have "window", the threading
/// guarantees needed for engine operation would be violated).
///
/// The engine is responsible for the entire life-cycle of the root isolate.
/// When the engine is collected, its owner assumes that the root isolate has
/// been shutdown and appropriate resources collected. While each engine
/// instance can only manage a single instance of a root isolate, it may restart
/// that isolate on request. This is how the cold-restart development scenario
/// is supported.
///
/// When the engine instance is initially created, the root isolate is created
/// but it is not in the |DartIsolate::Phase::Running| phase yet. It only moves
/// into that phase when a successful call to `Engine::Run` is made.
///
/// @see      `Shell`

/// @note     This name of this class is perhaps a bit unfortunate and has
///           sometimes been the cause of confusion. For a class named "Engine"
///           in the Flutter "Engine" repository, its responsibilities are
///           decidedly unremarkable. But, it does happen to be the primary
///           entry-point used by components higher up in the Flutter tech stack
///           (usually in Dart code) to peer into the lower level functionality.
///           Besides, the authors haven't been able to come up with a more apt
